## EXTRA CREDIT: Obfuscated Hello, World!

The name of this project is **ObfuscatedHelloWorld***.

**EXTRA CREDIT**: This project is an opportunity to earn extra credit by making an obfuscated Hello World program.

### Problem Description

There is no problem, just have fun and earn some extra credit. Your goal, should you choose to accept this assignment, is to make a program that simply prints out "Hello, World!". The challenge is to make it look, as little as possible, like it actually prints out "Hello, World!". In other words, obfuscate it's actual purpose. 

This is a deliberately open ended assignment, so have fun and be creative. The only rule is that it must, in the end, print out "Hello, World" and it must use, at some point, Java.

I will pick the top three submissions and those people will get 5,3 and 2 points of extra credit. All submissions will get at least 1 point of extra credit.

### Getting Started

Start this project however you want to. I would recommend starting an Eclipse project (which should be ease as this repository has a project already set up for you). Write your program and then turn it in.

### Running your program

Before you submit your project, put some notes here on how to run your program. You can put these notes in this README.md. Remember, if you want to be eligible for the 5, 3 or 2 points of extra credit, I should be able to easily run your program. 

**NOTE*** Leave directions here for me to run your program

### How to turn in this extra credit

The first step of turning in your code is to commit and push your code to GitHub. Once you've completed this step your code will be on BitBucket in your repository, not the repository for the class. This will allow you to use all your projects later as a portfolio.

To start the process write click your project and select **Team -> Commit...**. 

Now follow these steps to commit and push your code:

1. Select the files by check marking the files you want to commit. In this case **Main.java**. 
2. Enter a commit message. The commit message can be anything, but should describe the changes that are begin committed. A good commit message in this case might be "Committing code to check in for assignment"
3. Press **Commit and Push**

You will see a few more dialogs (including ones that may ask for your GitHub username and password) go by:

1. Push **OK** to complete the commit. You may get no confirmation, but you can check GitHub to see if the code now exists there.

#### Completing the turn-in process

Be sure to name your assignment on BitBucket so that I can easily identify it. I'm going to go to your profile and look for this assignment. If I can't easily find it, then you didn't turn it in.

**Note**: You do not need to use Bamboo to turn in this assignment.


**NOTE** You do not need to anything on Canvas to turn-in your assignment, but your grade will be posted on there so that you mab track your progress throughout the term.
